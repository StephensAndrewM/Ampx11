	<h1 class="mega-title">About Me</h1>

	<div class="section-content clearfix">

		<div class="column2 columnA">

			<p>I'm a full-time student at Tufts University, studying Computer Science. I find technology very intuitive, and I always enjoy learning something new. I have an eye for detail, which is also my way of saying I'm a bit of a perfectionist. I love any project that lets me think logically or creatively. Through the years I have acquired a rather unique skill set by having more hobbies than any one person can seemingly have time for, but I've never let time hold me back.</p>

			<p>I started learning web design and video editing when I was 12 years old. Of course I was more focused on the "how-to" at the time than the theory, but through years of practice and observations, I've come to appreciate industry trends and best practices. I began sound designing in high school, working with my school's theater department, eventually expanding to other nearby venues, gaining more experience with every event. Software was simply a natural progression from my love of programming, theory, and design. I'm currently learning Java for Android and Python for application development.</p>

			<p>Even though each of these fields has a very different and distinct workflow, I enjoy working with all of them simply because of the logic, problem-solving, openness, and creative potential involved in each.</p>

			<h2>Commercial Work</h2>

I am currently a full-time university student, and as a result my availability for things like this is generally limited to the summer, but I may be flexible during the year as well.</p>
